# Why Digital Archaeology?

I've got to say, I didn't originally sign up for this course because I'm interested in digital archaeology - there wasn't even an assigned topic for it when I added it to my timetable! I just saw it was one of like, two archaeology courses available this semester and jumped on it. But I am **super** glad that I did that because so far I am really into it, and I am very much looking forward to the rest of the semester. This bit of the introductory paragraph in particular really got me intrigued:
> This is not a textbook about learning how to code. Rather, it is about instilling the habits of thought that will enable success when confronted with digital novelty, the habits of thought that will enable you to determine how to work with digital materials, and the habits of thought that permit you to see where and when digital approaches will make the difference in your research.

As for why archaeology in general, I just think it is... very cool. Bioarchaeology and entomology are my two big interests, and had I struggled a little less in maths I would have gone straight into STEM. Before COVID (The new BC?) I was a volunteer at the Canadian Museum of Nature [Trading Post](https://nature.ca/en/home) and my dream is to remain in that line of work, but maybe as a paid position. Working with kids and learning stuff with them is a huge joy, and I say that in the most corny way possible. I was also supposed to have spent the summer in [Ferns, Ireland](https://ifrglobal.org/program/irelandferns/) working at a bioarchaeological field school, with a lot of public outreach as a selling point! I'm not sure what sort of image you'd like attached but here's a nice moth I found (white underwing)
