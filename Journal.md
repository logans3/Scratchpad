<h1>Journal: Week 1 Readings</h1>

I was originally frustrated by all the new accounts and things but this is the first time in a long time I've been able to sit down with a reasonable number of breaks and engage with readings and coursework in a fulfilling way? It's very nice.
This course has already touched on a lot of things I am really interested in, particularly wrt approaching Canadian archaeological issues while keeping some semblance of self-awareness of the shadow of settler-colonialism that *will* hang over everything I interpret. 
I did still struggle with a lot of the 'conceptual' points made in the readings, and I actually spent quite a lot of time googling and searching for other explanations for these things. Philosophical-y topics have always been a big struggle for me, and I have a really difficult time untangling people's ideas sometimes. I did try to add annotations for any vocabulary I had to google, but I did not do this with concepts I did not understand because I feel dumb. 

The <i>EmboDIYing Disruption</i> paper was very interesting to read. I think it was the topic/subject matter with which I was most familiar with, so I spent more time reflecting on what I was reading than on trying to understand what I was reading about, if that makes sense. Here's an attempt at breaking down my thoughts and reflections: 
- TERFdom in media and academia has made me wary of loud and proud feminism in these spaces
  - I am afraid that if say this too loudly I will cause Problems
  - Is this irony? 
- the author's inclusion of trans people in her article, and her salient point about marginalised groups not standing up for other marginalised groups was *such* a welcome sight, and is such an important thing to say in an article like this
> Queer, feminist, and maker communities, for instance, have been critiqued for not doing enough to recognize or stand in solidarity with their trans, indigenous, and/or black members in pre- and post-digital eras.
- this is the first non-indigenous studies course I've been in where we've gone **so hard** for inclusivity in academics in the first class, and I am very glad to see it.
  - like, for real
